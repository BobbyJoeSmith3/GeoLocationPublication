    <h1> Enhanced Sensory Communication Apparatus (ESCA)</h1>
    <section class="designFiction">
      <h2>Design Fiction</h2>
      <p>It is 2045. The Lakota Language Consortium (LLC) has evolved into the Lakota Language Computational and Interspecies Communication Council. The LLCICC has distributed amongst the tribe a basic Enhanced Sensory Communication Apparatus (ESCA) kit which are networked to quantum computers situated in undisclosed locations. Each tribal community has its own quantum computer that serves as its local node, however, access to the computational abilities of each local quantum computer is available to anyone on the network. For the Lakota, our quantum computer is situated in the Black Hills. Each tribe has its own database and server, which the quantum computers use for various quantum machine learning processes and to communicate to the ESCA devices.</p>
      <p>Distribution of the ESCA has been determined by the LCCICC. The LLCICC have passed a landmark intertribal resolution to distribute amongst all enrolled members of the participating tribes these ESCA kits which enable intertribal and interspecies translation, enhanced sensory communication, embedded media location, cultural database archiving, and wireless networked connection to a series of quantum computers owned and operated by participating tribes. This networked connection collects data from the enhanced sensory apparti which is encrypted and passed to a database. This data is fed to the quantum computers to improve data models and identify patterns in communication and behavior within tribes, between tribes, within species, and between species. This allows for realtime translation between the communication patterns found inter- and intra- indigenous languages and non-human species. It is also used to identify new concepts, thoughts, feelings, or situations for which we do not have language or for which we need new sensory stimuli to enhance the acquisition of the communicated meaning. Through this symbiotic process, new language is created to communicate emerging thoughts and new thoughts are enabled through emerging language. ESCA have been developed through the tribal colleges and tested on intergenerational test groups on the reservation, and within the language nests and language camps started as part of the language revitalization efforts within the tribes. Partnerships with ranchers, national parks, and keepers of indigenous seed banks and traditional gardens have allowed for testing and development among non-human species. Data transfer is encrypted through quantum processes, and certain media, data, or information is only translated, transferred, or made available based on honors earned and defined within each tribe.</p>
      <p>Communication improved through multi-sensory mediaâ€”haptic feedback, environmental shifts (smart/responsive/adaptive architecture), auditory, chemical (release of tears), augmented media, taste, smell, etc. Biological data which is recorded and fed to the quantum computers can identify personalized communication profiles. These communication profiles suggest sensory formulas that aid in the accurate translation, acquisition of meaning, and stimulation of memory.</p>
      <p>Sensory apparati do not have to be connected through wires, but rather have transmitters and receivers that translate data wirelessly. The ESCA system is not a single unit, but a kit of parts that can be distributed and replaced independently. Some units of the ESCA system can be embedded, while others can choose a less invasive method and are adorned. Perhaps different parts of the system are earned. Different ritual markers that connect you with the tribal community and the environment. Revival of traditional rituals, augmentation of traditional rituals, creation of new rituals through past processes. Revival, augmentation, and creation of societies. When you marry into a family or tribe, or get adopted into a family or tribe, there is a ceremonial transfer of ESCA units or access to databases are granted.</p>
      <p>Entries into the inter- and intra- tribal, inter species knowledge base is recorded through a distributed block chain ledger system. This allows for the augmentations, additions, and transactions in data from the knowledge base to be recorded and verified through the community ledger.</p>
